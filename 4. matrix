import numpy as np  # It's common practice to import numpy as np

# Initializing matrices
x = np.array([[1, 2], [4, 5]])
y = np.array([[7, 8], [9, 10]])

# Using add() to add matrices
print("The element-wise addition of matrices is: ")
print(np.add(x, y))  # Element-wise addition

# Using subtract() to subtract matrices
print("The element-wise subtraction of matrices is: ")
print(np.subtract(x, y))  # Element-wise subtraction

# Using dot() to multiply matrices (matrix multiplication, not element-wise)
print("The matrix multiplication (dot product) of matrices is: ")
print(np.dot(x, y))  # Matrix multiplication (dot product)

# Using .T to transpose the matrix
print("The transpose of the matrix x is: ")
print(x.T)  # Transpose of matrix x
